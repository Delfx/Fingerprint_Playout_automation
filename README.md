# Fingerprint_Playout_automation 

Demo code for testing fingerprinting algorithm found in (https://github.com/adblockradio/stream-audio-fingerprint). 

The main objective was to find a way to optimize the playout system with live shows.  

I was trying to find a solution to recognize commercial sound in Live SHOWS and if the sound was played send commands to the PLAYOUT system to play NEXT video in the playlist.  

So, I managed to find the solution and test the Fingerprint algorithm. 
But the code is not bulletproof and needs more digging in matching fingerprints algorithms from database.  

But in the testing phase is working for personal needs.
